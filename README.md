This is a beginner-friendly Spotify Clone project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It replicates the UI of Spotify and includes features like:

🎶 Music player with play/pause controls

⏩ Next/Previous track navigation

📂 Playlist section with songs

📱 Responsive design for desktop & mobile

The goal of this project is to practice frontend skills (HTML structure, CSS styling, Flexbox/Grid, and JavaScript DOM manipulation).
